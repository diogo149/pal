This chart shows a bunch of naive strategies trying for finding the best point to label. The data in this case is determining whether an image in MNIST is a 1 or a 7. The model starts with only 10 points in total, and we show the results of labelling 90 more points.
* Dependencies
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for examples)
- seaborn (optional,for examples)
* Running
Evaluate one of:
  1. ~python examples/mnist.py~
  2. ~python -m examples.mnist~
  3. ~ipython -i examples/mnist.py~ (my preference)
to download mnist data and generate a chart of the results (~mnist.png~).
